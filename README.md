# Stock-Tracker
This program allows for users to easily search for a companyâ€™s stock via their ticker symbol. Upon entering a ticker, the backend server
built on Java and SpringBoot make a request for the input and fetch relevant data for that stock from an external API. The backend server then 
maps the data back to client for the user to see.
